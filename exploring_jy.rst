Exploring Jython's Internals
============================

.. warning:: At present, this is not much more than a copy of the CPython original
   with the obviously inapplicable crudely hacked out.

This is a quick guide for people who are interested in learning more about
Jython's internals.
It provides a summary of the source code structure
and contains references to resources providing a more in-depth view.
Much may also be learned by :doc:`exploring CPython's internals <exploring>`.
